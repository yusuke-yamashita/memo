# My Perspective on the Japanese QA Community

## Purpose

This document is intended to convey the current state of the Japanese QA community to QA organizers who are not familiar with Japan. Specifically, it is aimed at explaining the Japan Test Community.

My intention is not to suggest, "If it doesn’t fit Japanese culture, don’t do it," but rather, "It’s a shame if people are interested but no one is teaching them." Currently, I cannot say that we are providing sufficient information to non-native Japanese speakers.

Therefore, I will describe what can be shared within the observation range of myself, Yamazun, and a few other committers.

Please keep in mind that this is not the consensus of all Japanese people, but merely the personal views of Yamazun and a few other committers.

Comments and feedback are more than welcome!

## The Current State of QA Events in Japan

Japanese software QA events include the following:

- JaSST
- SQiP Symposium
- Test Design Contest
- WACATE
- Test Automation Conference
- and more

### JaSST

JaSST is held in various locations across Japan, with about 11 regions hosting the event. This means that almost every month, it is held somewhere in Japan. The attendance ranges from around 50 people to as many as 2300 people.

JaSST is relatively inexpensive, with participation costs starting at a few thousand yen. Compared to overseas conferences, it seems to be quite affordable.

### SQiP Symposium

The SQiP Symposium is held annually around September. It consists of a one-day tutorial and two days of presentations. In recent years, participation was around 500 people before the COVID-19 pandemic.

The cost is just under 50,000 yen.

### Test Design Contest

The Test Design Contest is held annually from around October to January. Participants can join individually for 5000 yen or as a company for 55,000 yen.

Listening to the contest is free.

### WACATE

Held twice a year near Tokyo. It is a two-day event, with most of the program consisting of workshops.

The cost is just under 30,000 yen, including accommodation and meals.

### Test Automation Conference

Held once a year, before the pandemic it was held in Tokyo, and after the pandemic, it has been held online. Numerous examples and insights on automated testing in Japan are shared.

The event is free.

It is organized by the Test Automation Research Group.

## Characteristics of Japanese Events

### Strong Tendency to Focus on Aspects Other Than Automation

One characteristic of Japanese QA events is that "technical" does not only mean using computers or tools, but also includes how work is done and how things are devised.

#### Test Design Contest

This is particularly evident in the "Test Design Contest." The contest involves discussing and competing on "what should be tested," "how test cases should be created," and "what the overall test plan should look like."

#### Eight Principles of Test Automation by the Test Automation Research Group

The Test Automation Research Group has presented the [“Eight Principles of Test Automation”](https://sites.google.com/site/testautomationresearch/test_automation_principle). This includes concerns about "tests that are not properly analyzed or designed."

Both the Test Design Contest and the Eight Principles of Test Automation share a common focus: not just "using tools effectively" or "automating," but also thinking and devising with human intelligence, and seeking the right answer in an environment where there is no single correct answer. This is a key aspect that has been valued in the QA community.

### A Culture of Respecting and Enhancing Each Other's Events

There is a culture of not holding events in isolation but rather sharing knowledge within each other's events and enhancing the value of the events together. It is not common to promote one's own event unilaterally without sharing knowledge.

#### In the Case of JaSST

For example, the WACATE committee members may plan a workshop for testing at JaSST. The judges of the Test Design Contest may give lectures on test design.

#### In the Case of WACATE

The skills learned through workshops at WACATE may be tested in the Test Design Contest.

Participants and committee members of WACATE often become judges in subsequent Test Design Contests.

#### Collaboration Between Events

The major QA events such as JaSST, SQiP Symposium, WACATE, Test Design Contest, and Test Automation Conference share their schedules in advance to ensure that their event dates do not overlap.

## International Conferences that Many Japanese QA and Developers Attend

- Agile Testing Days
  - Recently, about five people attend every year.
  - A report meeting on Agile Testing Days is held almost every year.
- Selenium Conference
  - A few people attend every year.
  - There is a record of holding it in Japan (SeleniumConf Tokyo 2019).
- ICST
  - A few people attend every year.
  - There is a record of holding it in Japan (ICST 2017).
    - [https://www.aster.or.jp/conference/icst2017/index.html](https://www.aster.or.jp/conference/icst2017/index.html)

## The Origins of TQM

TBD
**This is beyond Yamazun's ability, so someone else should consider this.**
