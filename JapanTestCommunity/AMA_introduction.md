# AMA Session for Japan Test Community and Tokyo Test Fest

# What is the BakiBaki QA Channel?
- The BakiBaki QA Channel is where you can see what you want to see, know what you want to know, and learn what you want to learn.
- We do things that seem interesting.

## Purpose of Today
- The Organizer, Mesut Durukal (@DurukalMesut), will answer all your questions about the Japan Test Community and Tokyo Test Fest.
    - A parody of "Answering All of Lyrical's Questions."
- We want to clear up the "uncertainty" about JTC and TTF and establish them as reputable community events.
